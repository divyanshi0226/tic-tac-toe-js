Hi there! 
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Two players take turns — one is Player A and the other is Player B. The first one to make a straight line wins. If no one wins in 9 moves, it’s a draw. Simple, right? 

I made this project to practice how JavaScript can be used to handle game logic, DOM manipulation, and basic interactivity — all in the browser, without any frameworks.
You can click to place your move, and the game will automatically check who won or if it’s a draw.

 Tech Stack I Used

HTML – for creating the structure of the page
CSS – to style the board and make it look cleaner
JavaScript – where all the logic of checking winners, turns, and results happen

Here’s how it looks:
